# Claude Code for Product Managers

A specialized Claude Code configuration with custom agents and MCP integrations designed specifically for product management workflows.

## What's Included

- **Custom Agents** (`.claude/agents/`)
  - `project-writer` - Writes concise product projects without implementation details
  - `internal-information-researcher` - Searches across all integrated systems for comprehensive information
- **Custom Commands** (`.claude/commands/`)
  - `/delegate` - Coordinates tasks across multiple specialized agents
- **Tools** (`tools/`)
  - `export_granola_notes.js` - Export Granola meeting notes with transcripts
- **Pre-configured Permissions** for MCP integrations and productivity tools

## Prerequisites

Before using this configuration, you'll need:
1. Claude Code CLI installed and running
2. MCP servers configured for your integrations

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Claude Code

Claude Code is a CLI tool that runs directly in your browser or as a desktop app.

Follow the official Claude Code guide:
https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview

To get started:
1. Visit https://claude.ai/code
2. Sign in with your Anthropic account
3. Claude Code will be available in your browser or you can download the desktop app

### Step 2: Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattbean/claude-code-for-product-managers.git
cd claude-code-for-product-managers
```

### Step 3: Add MCP Integrations

Add the MCP servers you want to use. Run these commands in your terminal.

#### Atlassian (Jira and Confluence)

```bash
claude mcp add --transport sse atlassian https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse
```

#### Linear

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http linear https://mcp.linear.app/mcp
```

For more MCP servers and integrations, visit: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp

### Step 4: Start Claude Code

Start Claude Code in this project directory:

```bash
cd claude-code-for-product-managers
claude
```

### Step 5: Authenticate MCP Servers

Inside Claude Code, run:

```
/mcp
```

This will authenticate each MCP server you added. The custom agents and commands will now be available.

## Usage Examples

### Using Custom Agents

```
# Write a product project
Use the project-writer agent to create a project for improving user onboarding

# Research across all systems
Use the internal-information-researcher to find all discussions about pricing strategy
```

### Using the Delegate Command

```
/delegate Create a comprehensive competitive analysis for our main competitors
```

## Tools

### Granola Notes Exporter

Export your Granola.ai meeting notes with AI summaries and full transcripts to markdown files.

#### Usage

```bash
node tools/export_granola_notes.js
```

**Incremental sync:** The script automatically tracks the last export date and only exports new/updated notes on subsequent runs:
- First run: Exports all notes
- Subsequent runs: Only exports notes updated after the last export (with 1-day overlap to catch stragglers)
- Metadata tracked in `granola-notes/.last-export.json`

This will:
- Export AI-generated meeting summaries from the Granola API
- Include full transcripts from local cache (when available)
- Create markdown files in the `granola-notes/` directory
- Include YAML frontmatter with metadata (title, timestamps, IDs)
- Save export timestamp for next incremental sync

#### Agent Integration

The `internal-information-researcher` agent can automatically export and search your meeting notes. Just ask:

```
Find all discussions about the product roadmap from recent meetings
```

The agent will:
1. Run the export script to get latest notes
2. Search the exported markdown files for relevant information
3. Return findings with context from meetings

#### Output Format

Each exported file contains:
- **YAML frontmatter** - Meeting metadata
- **AI Summary** - Structured notes generated by Granola
- **Full Transcript** - Timestamped conversation with speaker attribution

Example output in `granola-notes/`:
```markdown
---
title: "MBI: Roadmap Sync"
created: 2025-11-12T16:00:09.476Z
has_transcript: true
---

## AI Summary
[Structured notes...]

## Full Transcript
**[11:00:21 AM] Speaker:** Hey. Good morning.
**[11:00:22 AM] You:** Good morning...
```

#### Requirements

- Granola.ai desktop app installed and authenticated
- Node.js installed (no npm packages required - uses built-in modules only)
- Credentials stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Granola/supabase.json`

## Customization

### Adding New Agents

Create new agent files in `.claude/agents/` following the existing format:

```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
description: Brief description of what this agent does
---

Agent instructions here...
```

### Modifying Permissions

Edit `.claude/settings.json` to adjust tool permissions as needed.

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Connections
- Ensure MCP servers are running: Check Claude Code logs
- Verify API credentials are correct
- Check network connectivity to external services

### Permissions Issues
- Review `.claude/settings.json` for proper tool permissions
- Ensure file paths in permissions match your system
